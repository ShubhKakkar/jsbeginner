Spring Cleaning MDN: Part 1
As we’re all aware by now, we made some big platform changes at the end of 2020. Whilst the big move has happened, it’s given us a great opportunity to clear out the cupboards and closets. The post Spring Cleaning MDN: Part 1 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

Getting lively with Firefox 90
As the summer rolls around for those of us in the northern hemisphere, temperatures are high and unwinding with a cool ice tea is high on the agenda. Isn't it lucky then that Background Update is here for Windows, which means Firefox can update even if it's not running. We can just sit back and relax!Also this release we see a few nice JavaScript additions, including private fields and methods for classes, and the at() method for Array, String and TypedArray global objects.This blog post just provides a set of highlights.The post Getting lively with Firefox 90 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript
When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

Looking fine with Firefox 89
Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.
